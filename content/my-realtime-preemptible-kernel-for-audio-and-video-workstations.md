Summary: a config file and some howtos to compile and install a fast Linux RT aka "realtime preemptible kernel" for audio and video workstations.

Many distributions come with partially (fake?) realtime (RT) low latency kernels not as preemptible as needed for audio and video processes which require very high system and hardware access priorities.

Note that even fast realtime video operations need fast and stable audio device accesses.

I then propose my own configuration and howtos to install a *real* RT kernel here:
