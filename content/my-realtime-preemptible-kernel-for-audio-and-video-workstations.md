Fast realtime audio and video operations need fast and stable accesses to the system devices. As many distributions come with partially (fake?) realtime (RT) low latency kernels not as preemptible as needed for audio and video processes which require very low level software and hardware system access priorities, I propose my own configuration and howtos to install a **real** RT kernel here:
