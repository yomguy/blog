During the last summer holidays, my dad accidentally made my laptop falled onto the floor. The LCD display has been broken even the super strong Thinkpad shield had nothing. As I needed to work a little bit, I have just extracted the SSD from the laptop (one screw on the Thinkpads :) ), mounted it into a external SATA/USB cable, booted it from my girlfriend laptop and YEAH, I had all my desktop and apps running from the USB disk in 5 mn!

Believe me, it is only possible with a Linux based system because it never bothers on what machine it is run on :)
