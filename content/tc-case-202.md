Summary: TC-202 "Case" has been released by Parisson

My company Parisson has just release its unique recording and broadcasting device namely TC-202 "Case". It is the only full mobile solution for audio and video recording and streaming.

I'm a bit proud of it beacause it synthetized all the Parisson "savoir-faire" in a hardware and software bundle. It's easy, fast, rock solid and 100 % Open Source !
