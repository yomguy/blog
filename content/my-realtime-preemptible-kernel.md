Fast realtime audio and video operations need stable, priority and realtime accesses to each system devices. As many distributions come with some partially or fake low latency kernels, i.e. not as preemptible as needed for **real** realtime processes, I propose my own configuration rules to install a better Linux RT kernel here:
