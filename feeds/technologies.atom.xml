I choose Pelican, a nice pyton app, which builds the entire blog from markdown or restructured text + some themes to regular HTML/CSS files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more SQL, no more upgrades, better portabilty, very easy editing and I hope no more spams (until Disqus gets hacked!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize to all people who contributed to the comments of my old blogs because these have been lost in the transition. I have retrieved some old articles I wanted to keep and put others in the web trashbin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm sure this new long term strategy will keep us to loose data again and again.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="about"></category></entry></feed>
